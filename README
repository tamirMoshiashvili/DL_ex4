## Tamir Moshiashvili - moshiat

# Requirements:
- python2.7
- numpy
- dynet
- Glove pre-trained vectors (840B)

# Instructions:
In order to run the model on the data, run the following:
python2.7 main.py glove_file [options]

## args:
    glove_file [options]
    * glove_file - path to the glove file (glove.840B.300d.txt)

    options:
    * --save model_name
        add the flag '--save' to save the model in case of training,
        model_name is the name of the saved-model.
    * --load pretrained_model_name
        add the flag '--load' to load a model from a file,
        pretrained_model_name is the path to the file to load the model from.
    * --train train_file dev_file
        add the flag '--train' in order to train the model,
        train_file is the path to the train file (json),
        dev_file is the path to the dev file (json).
    * --test test_file
        add the flag '--test' in order to test the model on the file,
        test_file is the path to the test file (json).

## examples:
- in order to train the model with saving it into a file named 'last.model':
    python2.7 main.py glove.840B.300d.txt --save last.model --train snli_1.0/snli_1.0_train.jsonl snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl
- in order to continue training pre-trained model, named 'last.model' and save it into a new file named 'new.model'
    python2.7 main.py glove.840B.300d.txt --load last.model --save new.model --train snli_1.0/snli_1.0_train.jsonl snli_1.0/snli_1.0_dev.jsonl
- in order to load a model, named 'last.model', and check the accuracy:
    python2.7 main.py glove.840B.300d.txt --load last.model --test snli_1.0/snli_1.0_test.jsonl
